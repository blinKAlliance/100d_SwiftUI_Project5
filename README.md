# Word Scramble
The game will show players a random eight-letter word, and ask them to make words out of it. For example, if the starter word is “alarming” they might spell “alarm”, “ring”, “main”, and so on.
This aims to make use of things like List, onAppear(), Bundle, fatalError(), and more – all useful skills that I’ll use for years to come. I’ll also get some practice with @State, NavigationView, and more. 
Project guidelines were recieved inside the 100 Days of SwiftUI Course located here: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui (Day 29)
